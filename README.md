# ðŸŒž Hello, welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Tokyo based freelance Software Engineer who is currently still polishing up my programming skills.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
  - Networking with people in the field
  - Job opportunities as a SWE
  - Learning new skills/ language (both "computer language" and human language haha)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Javascript**
- â™Ÿ Iâ€™d love to be able to **collaborate on open source projects**
- ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, I usually **spend my time juggling between my hobbies**.
